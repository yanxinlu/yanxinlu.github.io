Hello! üëã 

My name is **Amber (Yanxin) Lu**, and I am a master‚Äôs student in **Electrical Engineering** at the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](https://www.caltech.edu/). I completed my undergraduate studies in **Computer Engineering** at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) - [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) Joint Institute ([ZJU-UIUC](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en)), where I spent my junior year as an exchange student at UIUC, an experience that greatly enriched my academic and practical background.

During the exchange year, I participated in the **SciCode** project under [Prof. Hao Peng](https://haopeng-nlp.github.io/), where we developed a coding benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to solve complex, real-world scientific problems. This work has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2024**. I also worked with [Prof. Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) on projects aimed at improving LLMs' reasoning abilities and evaluating LLM's performance in research scenarios. As part of this collaboration, I co-developed **DIPNet (Distributional Input Projection Network)**, a framework for enhancing model generalization across vision and language tasks. In Summer 2024, I interned at [Lilith Games](https://www.lilith.com/?locale=en-US), where I worked on applying large language models to automated game testing and machine translation optimization. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with [Prof. Qiang Zhang](https://qiangairesearcher.github.io/) to explore molecular retrosynthesis using LLMs.

Looking ahead, I am passionate about exploring how large language models can drive innovation in specialized domains. I am currently seeking **internship opportunities for Summer 2026** or **full-time positions starting in January 2027**, where I can contribute to impactful, AI-driven projects.

Outside of work, my greatest joy comes from spending time with my lovable cat, [Putao](https://yanxinlu.github.io/putao/)üçá!

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations!

# Research Interest

I am interested in developing and optimizing large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications. My goal is to enhance the trustworthiness and robustness of LLMs, improving human-AI collaboration to ensure that LLMs effectively assist across diverse contexts while maintaining their reliability.
